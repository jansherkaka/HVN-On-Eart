      </h1>
      <p class="text-lg font-syne mb-5">In this enlightening conversation, Pranna the Black Shaman and Sophia Kapri discuss the concept of fear, its illusory nature, and how individuals condition themselves to accept it. They explore the power of reconditioning the psyche to overcome fear by activating a higher self-consciousness, thus transforming negative emotions like anxiety, nervousness, and doubt into positive energy. The discussion covers the impact of social media on fear, the importance of controlling one's own energy and thoughts, and the role of emotions as energy in motion, emphasizing self-awareness and control over one's emotional responses. Pranna encourages individuals to tap into their psyche and use their inner power to shape their reality, challenging them to take control of their emotions and thoughts to live a life free from fear.
